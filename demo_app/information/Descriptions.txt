Description of each folder:

    .expo-shared:
        EXPO-generated folder. This folder is just used for expo, shouldn't be changed

    assets:
        Contains assets used for app such as font files and images (for background, icon, loading screen, etc.)

    screens:
        Contains all of the screens used in this app.

    navigation:
        Contains navigator file. This is responsible for moving between screens and transitions

    node_modules:
        EXPO-generated folder. Contains all the packages needed to run this, and when you run something like
        "npm install" or "expo install" it installs stuff into this folder. 

    store:
        Has two folders: Reducers, and Actions. The reducer describes the state and how we want to update it
        after a given action. Actions contain functions that act on our state, and are used in other files to
        manage the state.


Description of each file:

    App.js:
        This file contains our app. It should be small and mostly consist of import statements. Most of the stuff
        in the app (navigator, screens, reducer, etc.) Should be distributed in other files and imported into App.js

    app.json:
        This file contains information used for publishing the app. We don't need to worry about this until it goes
        on the app/google play store.

    babel.config.js:
        EXPO-generated. We don't need to deal with this.

    package-lock.json:
        EXPO-generated. We don't need to deal with this.

    package.json:
        EXPO-generated. We don't need to deal with this.
